<h1>About me</h2>
<p>
  I am a programmer, mentor, speaker and author who spends most of my time <a href="http://scalablesolutions.eu">consulting</a>, hacking on open source as well as lecturing and speaking at developer conferences world-wide. I have worked at Terracotta, the JRockit JVM at BEA and am an active contributor to the Open Source community; most notably created the AspectWerkz Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework, committer to the Terracotta JVM clustering technology and been part of the Eclipse AspectJ team.
