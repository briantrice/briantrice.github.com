I have worked at Terracotta, the JRockit JVM at BEA and is an active contributor to the Open Source community; most notably created the Akka Project, AspectWerkz Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework, committer to the Terracotta JVM clustering technology and been part of the Eclipse AspectJ team. In 2011 I also became a Java Champion.
