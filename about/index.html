<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
I'm a entrepreneur, programmer, teacher, mentor, speaker and author. I'm the co-founder and CTO of Typesafe and have previously worked at Terracotta and the JRockit JVM at BEA Systems. I am an active contributor to the Open Source community; most notably created the Akka Project, the AspectWerkz Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework, committer to the Terracotta JVM clustering technology and been part of the Eclipse AspectJ team. In 2011 I became a Java Champion.

I'm also a happily married husband, a proud dad to two boys, a passionate skier (alpine, telemark and snowboard) and jazz saxophone player (tenor, alto and soprano).
