<h1>
JRockit 5 Memory Leak Tool
</h1>
The upcoming release of JRockit will contain a new, completely killing, tool for memory leak detection.

It allows you to (among many other things) to profile an application running in production with (almost) zero overhead (without shutting it down or any preparation whatsoever).

<a href="http://jboss.org/jbossBlog/blog/bburke/?permalink=7EBA719FA8D7C246482F5E30A5DEDFB1.txt">Bill Burke</a> and <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/000833.html">Dion Almaer</a> has already blogged about it.

Go and check it out. It is free (shipped with JRockit).
