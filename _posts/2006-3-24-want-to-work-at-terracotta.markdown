We are currently hiring developers to work in a team that is crafting an innovative container/runtime to provide transparent runtime services for Java objects (POJOs). 

Requires knowledge in the following areas: 
<ul>
	<li>Object-Oriented Programming and design, patterns etc.
</li>

	<li>Deep understanding how Java works, including class loading, garbage collection etc.
</li>

	<li>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
</li>

	<li>Concurrent and parallel processing techniques
</li>

	<li>Knowledge of distributed programming and component models (sockets, JMS, RMI, EJB etc.)
</li>

	<li>Knowledge of the current state-of-the-art in JEE today, including standards, best-practices, patterns and anti-patterns, open source and proprietary frameworks etc.
</li>
</ul>

Experience in the follow areas is considered a plus:
<ul>
	<li>Bytecode manipulation and analysis
</li>

	<li>Dynamic languages such as JavaScript, Smalltalk, CLOS, Ruby, BeanShell, Groovy and Python
</li>
</ul>

Culture 
<ul>
	<li>Must be able to express ideas clearly
</li>

	<li>Must be a team player
</li>
</ul>

Does this describe you? 

Do you like to write application servers instead of use them? Are you dissatisfied with the current state of JEE, with tons of incoherent XML config and thousands of APIs? Do you hate complexity when without cause? Do you believe that two heads are better than one and that ideas are what matters. 

If this describes you then come and work at <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/">Terracotta</a> (based in San Francisco). 

You should have excellent programming abilities and design sense, and be capable of working closely with team members on design and implementation (XP-style).

If you think this sounds interesting, then drop me an email.
