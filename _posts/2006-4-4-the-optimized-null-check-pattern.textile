<h1>
The Optimized Null Check Pattern
</h1>
A friend of mine showed me The Optimized Null Check Pattern (TM) yesterday (found in a piece of production code):

<pre>
public static boolean isNull(Object obj) {
    boolean isNull;
    try {
        obj.toString();
        isNull = false;
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        isNull = true;
    }
    return isNull;
}
</pre>

Then a colleague pointed out to me that a variation of the pattern (not as clean though) is actually used by Sun. 

From the <code>java.util.logging.LogRecord</code> class:

<pre>
<code>
public LogRecord(Level level, String msg) {
    // Make sure level isn't null, by calling random method.
    level.getClass();
 
    ...
}
</code></pre>
