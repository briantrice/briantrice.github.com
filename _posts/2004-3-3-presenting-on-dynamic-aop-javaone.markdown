I was lucky and our submission to <a href="http://servlet.java.sun.com/javaone/">JavaOne</a> was accepted. 
<p/>
This means that <a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/avasseur/">Alex</a> and I will do a presentation on "Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming in J2EE environments". 
<p/>
See you there.
