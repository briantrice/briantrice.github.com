Terracotta is hosting webinar on how to do grid computing using standard Java 5 code.

This session focuses on the Master/Worker pattern -- one of the most useful parallel programming design patterns in use today. 

You will learn about the identifying characteristics of the pattern and how best to use it in the real world.

It is a very practical, "hands-on" session in which we will present how to build the Master/Worker pattern using standard JDK 1.5, and how to turn it into a distributed grid implementation by using Network-Attached Memory. Following that, we will cover the production implications of operating and scaling a reliable work management framework.

Attendees will learn:

<ul>
	<li>How to identify cases where the Master/Worker pattern is the right solution</li>

	<li>How to build a distributed Master/Worker pattern with 100% POJO-based Java</li>

	<li>How to cluster the JVM and effectively use Network-Attached Memory</li>

</ul>
