<a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ 5</a> final is finally shipped.

This means that the <a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj/aj5announce.html">merger</a> with <a href="http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/">AspectWerkz</a> is complete and that the most important chapter in the history of AOP has been completed (IMHO). Finally we have a standardized language and toolkit and can, both as developers and users, try to (finally) pull in the same direction. For more info, read Adrian Colyers' <a href="http://www.aspectprogrammer.org/blogs/adrian/2005/12/aspectj_150_is.html">blog announcement</a> or the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/README-150.html">release page</a>.

Go ahead and download the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/downloads.php">stand alone compiler</a> or the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/">AJDT IDE toolkit</a> (with an embedded compiler).

Time to have some fun.
