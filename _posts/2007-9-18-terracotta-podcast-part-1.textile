Interviewed by Xebia: Part 1
</h1>
<a href="http://xebia.com/">Xebia</a> did an interview with me some months ago in which we discuss things like <a href="http://terracotta.org/">Terracotta</a>, scale-out and high-availability for Java, JVM-level clustering, network-attached memory, distributed and concurrent programming, JEE best practices etc. 

The interview is split up in two parts, the first one being more of an overview while the second one discusses things in more detail.

You can find the first part <a href="http://podcast.xebia.com/Xebia_Audio_and_Video_Podcast/Entries/2007/9/19_Episode_11_-_Terracotta_Part_1.html">here</a>. 

Second part will be published in 2 weeks.
