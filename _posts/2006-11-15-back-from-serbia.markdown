I just got back from a small JUG roadshow in Serbia. I did two 2 1/2 hours talk in two days, the first one in Novi Sad and the second one in Belgrade. Both talks were well attended, ~100 attendees per session. Serbia seems to be a thriving Java community and there was a lot of interest in both <a href="http://terracottatech.com/terracotta_spring.shtml">Terracotta for Spring/Spring Web Flow</a> as well as in using <a href="http://terracottatech.com/terracotta_DSO.shtml">Terracotta DSO</a> as a generic distributed computing platform.

During these two days I met a lot of interesting and warm hearted people, and was met with great hospitality throughout the trip. Unfortunately I did not have enough time to see much of the country, but I got a Serbia Travel Guide book as a gift so I guess I have to come back some time (and bring the family). 

Finally I had a really good time (and interesting discussions) going out to lunch with <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/SpringDotNET-QnA">Aleks Seovic</a>, the <a href="http://www.springframework.net/">Spring.NET</a> lead (currently living in Belgrade), talking about <a href="http://terracottatech.com/">Terracotta </a>vs. <a href="http://tangosol.com/html/index.shtml">Tangosol</a>, <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Java </a>vs. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/default.mspx">.NET</a>, including more important things than geeky matters. 

All in all, a great trip.
