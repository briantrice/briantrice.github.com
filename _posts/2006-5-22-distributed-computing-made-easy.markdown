My latest article for <a href="http://www.theserverside.com">TheServerSide.com</a>, titled <em>Distributed Computing Made Easy</em>, is published. In this article, I walk through a fairly generic but common distributed computing problem and shows how it can be simplified using <a href="http://terracottatech.com/">Clustering at the JVM level</a>, the <a href="http://springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html">Java 5's concurrency libraries</a>.

The article can be found <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=DistCompute">here</a>.
