<h1>
AOP standardization process started
</h1>
<p/>
Renaud Pawlak, the creator of <a href="http://jac.aopsys.com/">JAC</a> has started up a project called <a href="http://aopi.sourceforge.net">AOPI</a>, which has the goal of specifying a common set of components for aspect-oriented systems.
<br/>
From the homepage:
<blockquote>
AOPI are a standard specification of a set of useful or mandatory componants for aspect-oriented systems. 
<p/>
The idea is to have a common set of abstract components specifications, distributed under a Public Domain licence, that will help all the projets to communicate and reuse components coming from other projects. 
</blockquote>
This is a really good idea an I'm looking forward to some interesting discussions on the mailinglist. :-)
