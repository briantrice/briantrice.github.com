<a href="http://terracottatech.com/">Terracotta</a> and <a href="http://interface21.com/">Interface21</a> will hold a joint WebEx on how to cluster an arbitrary <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a> application or <a href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/WEBFLOW/Home;jsessionid=aamZesJzuupaxFKcE0">Spring WebFlow</a> application transparently (no changes to existing application code) and declaratively in less than 30 minutes. 

<a href="http://blog.springframework.com/rob/">Rob Harrop</a> and me will talk about the benefits and drawbacks with using state-of-the-art clustering technologies such as database, JMS or custom API (such as JCache etc.) and then talk about the benefits with and why we need clustering at the JVM level and how that is done in the <a href="http://terracottatech.com/terracotta_spring.shtml">Terracotta for Spring</a> product. 

If you are in need to scale out you Spring application or are in need for fail-over then you should call in to the WebEx.
