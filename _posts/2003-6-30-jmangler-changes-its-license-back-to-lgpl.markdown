title: JMangler changes its license back to LGPL

<a href="http://javalab.iai.uni-bonn.de/research/jmangler/">JMangler</a> will change its license back to LGPL (for some reason they changed to GPL for the 3.x release).
<p/>
The change to GPL did of course cause a lot of problems for <a href="http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/">AspectWerkz</a> (which is licensed under LGPL and uses JMangler) and I have since then tried to persuade the JMangler team to change its license back to LGPL. 
<p/>
Yesterday I recieved this letter from Michael Austermann, the creator of JMangler:
<blockquote>
Hi Jonas,

I've been to canda for the last weeks and was unable to read/reply any
emails. We will change the the licence of JMangler back to LGPL within the
next one or two weeks.

Michael

So for all of you who have hesitated in using <a href="http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/">AspectWerkz</a> in a commercial application: go for it, you will love it. :-)
