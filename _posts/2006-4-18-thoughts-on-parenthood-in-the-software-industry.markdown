title: Thoughts On Parenthood In The Software Industry

I have been thinking some about parenthood in the software industry, in particular, of frameworks and technologies. Men that have been the driving force behind, invented, or founded a particular technology or framework, are often referred to as <em>"The Father Of..."</em>. 

Is this really a fair and accurate metaphor? 

The <em>father</em> usually gets away easy with the easy part (of just bootstrapping the whole process).

While it is the <em>mother</em> that:
<ul>
	<li>has to carry the baby for nine months (product development)</li>

	<li>has to do all the labor and go through all the pain in the delivery (shipping and release) process</li>

	<li>usually has to do most of the maintenance</li>
</ul>

I would like to suggest switching to using the metaphor <em>"The Mother Of..."</em> (regardless of the sex of the subject).
