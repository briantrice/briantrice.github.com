The past month I have been asked the same question over and over again: "Why did you open source Terracotta?". It is odd, but it seems that for some people the question "why did they do it?" is much more interesting then "what does it mean - for me - for the industry?" 

I will continue to spend most of my time trying to answer the latter question. But since the former one keeps coming up and is for many people still an unanswered question, I will point you to a good write up on the subject written by our CEO Amit Pandey:

<blockquote><a href="http://opensource.sys-con.com/read/318781.htm">Building a Sustainable Open Source Business</a>
â€” Terracotta took a major step this month by open sourcing all of our Java clustering technology. We believe that this step will make a powerful clustering option readily available to the Java community and indeed could help make the notion of clustering itself simpler and more ubiquitous. This is an initiative that is many months in the making, and I wanted to share our thinking and motivation for it with you.</blockquote>
