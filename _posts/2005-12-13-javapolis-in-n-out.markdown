I am heading for <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/Home">JavaPolis</a> tomorrow morning. Will be spending 24 h in Antwerp, doing two talks, hoping to hang out with some good friends, build new relations, drink the excellent <a href="http://www.trappistbeer.net/">Belgian Trappist Beer</a> (favorite is <a href="http://www.chimay.be/www/chimay/site8/en/a_abbaye/a0_frameset.htm">Chimay</a>) and have some fun...

Why the rush? Well, I have simply been travelling way too much lately (JavaOne Japan - 1 week, Terracotta in SF - 1 week and The Spring Experience in Miami - 1 week) and my 2 year old son is starting to be disappointed in me...
