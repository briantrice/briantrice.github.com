I had the privilege of sitting in the sixth row during Keith Jarrett's solo concert at War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco yesterday evening.

It was a fantastic concert and musical experience, something I will carry with me for a long time.

Jarrett's solo concerts are always completely improvised (meaning both themes, chords, melodies and solos) musical adventures, in which he mixes jazz, classical music, lyricsm, avant-garde and more.

He is, IMHO, the world's most brilliant pianist and composer, and experiencing his musical brinkmanship and mastery yesterday was indeed, as one reviewer wrote, a "life-altering" experience.

The concert was recorded, so it might be available on CD in a near future.
