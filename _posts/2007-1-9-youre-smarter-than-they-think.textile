<h1>
You're Smarter Than They Think
</h1>
[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) has written yet an amazing and inspirational piece on [how to be remarkable](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/how_to_be_remar.html). It is a short write-up of some of the ideas he has been talking and writing about for years. 

Read it, be inspired and then...**make something happen**. 

I am currently reading his new book [Small Is the New Big](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591841267/permissionmarket), which is a collection of the best columns, blog posts and articles he has written over the years. It's a gem. 

If you have the urge to achieve something more in life, feel stuck, don't dare taking the leap of faith to do what you are made to do and have a creativity nerve that keeps on nagging, then read it. Please read it. It might actually change your life. 

...as its back cover boldly proclaims: "you're smarter than they think".
