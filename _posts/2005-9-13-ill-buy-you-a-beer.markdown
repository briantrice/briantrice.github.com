I am at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/javaprolive/">JavaPro Live!</a> in San Diego <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/javaprolive/sessions.aspx#aopdriven">doing a presentation </a>titled: "AOP-Driven Services: Achieve Modularity and Reusability on the J2EE Platform" (the talk is 3:15 on Thursday Sept 14:th). If you are attending the conference, stop by and say hi. 

I just finished rewriting the master template for the slides to follow a terra-cotta based color scheme. ;-) 

This is actually my second week as a <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/">Terracotta</a> employee and I am looking forward to the upcoming months. We are currently sketching on some very interesting new stuff, among other things, stuff tied to transparent runtime environments. More on that later. 

I will, from now on, spend a lot of time in San Francisco, so if you are in the area, drop me an email and I will buy you a beer :-)
 
Just a warning: If it turns out that you have not tried Terracotta's Virtualization Server and its <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/product/dso.html">Distributed Shared Objects (DSO)</a>, you will most likely here me rambling about that it is <b>The</b> way of doing distributed programming in Java (e.g. clustering and caching) and why you have to give it a try.
