wordpress_url: http://jonasboner.com/?p=40
---
The <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/08/jvm_aop_2.html">second part</a> of our article series about <a href="http://commerce.bea.com/products/weblogicjrockit/5.0/jr_50.jsp">JRockit </a>JVM support for AOP is now published.

This article describes in more detail on how the API is used, showing some code samples and ends with a discussion in which we try to explain how we address the questions and issues (around the shortcomings of bytecode manipulation) raised in <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/08/jvm_aop_1.html">part one</a> in the series.

The prototype will be downloadable soon, stay tuned.
