The last year has been a ride. 

"Startup":http://triental.com in finance business, green field development, challenging and interesting problem domain, been pushing "Scala":http://scala-lang.org to its limits in a real-world production setting. Its been a lot of fun and a great learning experience. (I have written some about the way we have used Scala in the "Real-World Scala" series of blog posts, check the "archives":/archives if you are curious.) 

But now its all over. Zero cash flow in. Knocked out by the financial crisis. To bad, we had a great product coming. But not much to do. 

The good news is that I am back in the consulting business. Rewrote and redesigned my company site to mark the beginnning of a new era...well, at least a "new" job. 

Check it out and let me know if you need help :-)
