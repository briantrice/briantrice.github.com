AOSD.05 has started
</h1>
<a href="http://aosd.net/2005/index.php">AOSD 2005</a> has just started. I am excited, and have high expectations since last years conference was a real hit, and this year we have a separate industry track with many interesting talks coming up, f.e. Grady Booch is doing a keynote.  

I will be giving a talk on AspectWerkz 2 and the road to AspectJ 5 at the AOSD 2005 conference hosted at the Intercontinental hotel in Chicago.

If you are in the area, please drop in and say hi.

If you are interested you can read the abstract etc. <a href="http://aosd.net/2005/industry/talk3.php">here</a> 

For those who can't make it, I will make the slides available online after the conference.

Hope to see you there...
