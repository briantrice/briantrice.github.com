util.concurrent on steroids
</h1>
Steve has written a <a href="http://blog.terracottatech.com/archive/2005/08/fun_with_dso_an.html#more">nice article</a> on how you can coordinate threads in a distributed application, transparently, and with very little effort. 

He does this simply by sharing an instance of a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html">CyclicBarrier</a>, a class in Doug Lea's excellent <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">util.concurrent package</a>(now included in JDK 5.0), across a cluster  Using <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/product/dso.html">Distributed Shared Objects </a>(DSO). 

It really shows the power of DSO in action, by solving an extremely tricky problem in almost no time and no code.
