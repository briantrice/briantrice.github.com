Terracotta DSO Explained
</h1>
Along with the 1.5 release of the <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/product_overview.shtml">Terracotta Server</a> (shipped today), we have new web site along with a really good flash demo explaining our DSO (Distributed Shared Objects) technology.

It takes you through the concepts and ideas behind the technology as well as shows you a couple of live demos, definitely worth the 5 minutes it takes to watch it.

Just browse to the <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/index.shtml">web site</a> and click on [View Our Demo].
