Thoughts on Harmony

Floyd Marinescu <a href="http://dynamicsemantics.blog-city.com/harmonyintelcontribution.htm">recently blogged</a> about that the latest contribution from Intel was evidence that God (IBM?) has big plans for <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/harmony/">Harmony</a>.

I wish I could be that optimistic, and I perhaps should, since Floyd usually does not say things that are not well backed up with facts. 

I really like the idea of an open source JVM, where companies could contribute with the parts that they can do best (native ports etc.). But just some class library is basically nothing (we already have <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a>, and who is using that for real...?).

What is necessary, and basically the only thing that could make the Harmony project fly is for either BEA to donate <a href="http://www.bea.com/content/products/jrockit/index.htm">JRockit</a> or IBM to donate <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/wireless/wctme/">J9</a>. 

Why? 

First, it is practically impossible for a distributed non-full-time team to develop an enterprise class JVM within this century.

Second, these JVMs are the two single clean room implementations out there (e.g. that are not in any way derived from Sun HotSpot).

Geir, do you have any cards left to play? ;-)
