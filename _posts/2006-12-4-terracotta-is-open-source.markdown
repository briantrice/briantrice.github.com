Today we open sourced Terracotta and launched a new site for the Open Terracotta Project; <a href="http://terracotta.org/">http://terracotta.org</a>.

Personally, I am very excited and think that Open Terracotta's potential impact on the Java community cannot be underestimated. Even though it is in clustering, meaning scalability and high-availability, that it can bring its most immediate value to the community, it is really a platform for solving generic distributed computing and shared memory problems in plain Java code - something that makes it applicable to a wide range problem domains. I am very curious to see what the Java community - thinking out-of-the-box - can/will do with it.

Get involved. Download it, play with it, use it and then contribute.
