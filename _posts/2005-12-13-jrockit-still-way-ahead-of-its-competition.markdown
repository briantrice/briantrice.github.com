<p><a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/jrockit/">JRockit</a> is still miles ahead of its competitors, both when it comes to speed and manageability/tool support.</p>
<p>Today, JRockit released its <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t59426.html">latest SPECjbb2000 benchmark</a> (J2EE benchmark), in which it set a new world record, leaving Sun's HotSpot in the dust...</p>
<p>It also keeps improving its excellent tool support and manageability. Please read <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/blog/hirt/">Marcus Hirt's</a> new articles <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/12/jrockit-5.html">JRockit 5.0 The JVM at Your Fingertips</a> and <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/12/jrockit-mission-control.html">An Introduction to JRockit Mission Control</a> as well as <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/blog/sla/">Staffan Larsen's</a> article about JRockit's unique memory leak tool: <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/06/memory_leaks.html">Memory Leaks, Be Gone!</a>. </p>
<p>Today, there is really only one single valid excuse for not running JRockit and that is if you are deploying on non-intel architecture, and this reason will be terminated in the upcoming releases (with ports to Sparc, HP-UX etc.). </p>
<p>(...and please don't start rambling about instability again, that was an old (and then I mean really old) problem, the last releases, including the latest one, have been of very high quality - which, in my experience, have had better stability than Sun HotSpot's comparable versions.)
