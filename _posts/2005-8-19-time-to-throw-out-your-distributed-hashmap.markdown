<a href="http://www.pcal.net/blog/">Patrick Calahan</a> has written an <a href="http://blog.terracottatech.com/archive/2005/08/object_identity.html">interesting article</a> on Distributed Shared Objects (DSO) and how they compare to traditional ways of doing caching and clustering. DSO might just as well be the death of the the distributed hashmap, e.g. JCache etc. Seems to be the only sane way of doing clustering in Java.
