One, out of many great advice, coming from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X/sr=8-1/qid=1144104507/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-3443519-2815145?%5Fencoding=UTF8">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> (a book that has sort of been my manifesto the last years), is that you should try to learn a new programming language every year. 

You should do this, not because you need to use it in your daily work (even though that is undoubtly the best way of learning a new language), but because it will widen your horizon, help you think and solve (your day-to-day) problems differently and better.  

I have tried to follow this advice the last years (even though I have some gaps) and the last months my interest has been into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative programming</a>.

So the "Language Of The Year" 2006 is <a href="http://scala.epfl.ch/">Scala </a>along with a deeper dive into <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/">Oz</a>. 

History:

<ul>
	<li>Scala and Oz</li>

	<li>2005 - nil</li>

	<li>2004 - nil
</li>
	<li>2003 - Groovy
</li>
	<li>2002 - AspectJ
</li>
	<li>2001 - Oz
</li>
	<li>2000 - Ruby
</li>
	<li>1999 - XML
</li>
	<li>1998 - Python and Jython
</li>
	<li>1997 - Java
</li>
</ul>

(The language of 2007 is probably going to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_programming_language">Haskell</a>, but let's not get ahead of ourselves).
