I am writing this blog post in a total chaos of bags, boxes, skiing and outdoor gear, books, pacifiers, computers etc.

Tomorrow I am catching the plane to San Francisco, nothing special about that apart from that this time I am taking my family with me and we are planning on staying there on a permanent basis (at least for 3-4 years).

A lot of excitement and anxiety in the air, but I think that we will have a lot of fun. Living in San Francisco, closer to my collegues and friends at <a href="http://www.terracottatech.com/">Terracotta</a>, not more than 3 h from the <a href="http://www.skiheavenly.com/">mountains</a> around Lake Tahoe and being able to enjoy the great <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=weather+san+francisco">California weather</a> all year around sounds like a good start. :-)

If you live in the area and are <a href="http://www.thirstybear.com/">up for a beer</a> then drop me a line.
