<p />
Today we released the 0.10 Release Candidate 1 of <a href="http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/">AspectWerkz</a>.  Which forms the foundation for the next generation of AspectWerkz.

<p />
AspectWerkz has gone through a lot of changes, the whole core engine has for example been thrown out and replaced by a much more flexible and performant one.  The join point model is much more expressive and orthogonal we have also implemented a JIT compiler that is making AspectWerkz much more performant.  On top of that we have a new implementation of true runtime weaving, which allows you to redefine your aspect model including adding <b>new</b> pointcuts at runtime.
