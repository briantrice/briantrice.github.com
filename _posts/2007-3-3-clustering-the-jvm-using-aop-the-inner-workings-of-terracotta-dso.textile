Clustering the JVM using AOP: the Inner Workings of Terracotta DSO
</h1>
Our paper for <a href="http://www.aosd.net/2007/">AOSD 2007</a> has been published. It is titled 'Clustering the Java Virtual Machine using Aspect-Oriented Programming' and is a thorough and pragmatic discussion on how <a href="http://terracotta.org/">Terracotta's JVM-level clustering technology</a> is implemented from an AOP and bytecode weaving perspective. The discussion is driven by examples in AspectJ. 

The paper is available for download <a href="http://www.aosd.net/2007/program/industry/I1-ClusteringJVMUsingAOP.pdf">here</a>.
